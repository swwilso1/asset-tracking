The Asset Tracking and Monitoring application uses a packaged version of the [UI Components](https://github.com/scriptrdotio/UIComponents/tree/rc0.1) library. If you would like to modify this library and use it in this application, checkout the rc0.1 branch of this library  on a local environment, and run the following Gruntfile.js on the root directory of the UIComponents to build a package.
